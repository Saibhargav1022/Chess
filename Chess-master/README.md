Welcome to the **Chess-Game**! This project is a simple implementation of the Mind Thinking Game Between Two Members  using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction

**Chess-Game** Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. It is one of the oldest and most popular games in the world. The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means putting the king under an inescapable threat of capture.

## Features

- Mind Thinking user interface.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone - "https://github.com/DineshDuvvuri/Chess-game.git" `.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can play the game online by visiting [Chess](https://d-chess.netlify.app/).

## Usage

- Arrange pieces on the board with each player's pieces on their closest two rows.
- Each piece has its own way of moving (e.g., pawns move forward, knights move in an "L" shape).
- White moves first, followed by Black; players take turns.
- Employ strategies like attacking multiple pieces at once or protecting your king.
- Win by putting your opponent's king in a position where it cannot escape capture.
